            <p>
              Recite is a mobile application aimed at improving self-confidence
              in public speaking. The project was designed and developed by
              Thomas Kelly as part of the NCAD Major Project in the Interaction
              Design BA programme.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over a span of 5 months, Recite evolved from an initial concept to
              multiple iterations of interactive prototypes. The project brief
              required a creative technologies approach, which guided the design
              and development process.

              imposter syndrome in stakeholder meetings, and a best-man who is

                  A strict evaluation testing method using a control, and other

                  observers, to practicing a speech using memory and repetition

                  confirmation of Recite moving in the direction of being a more

                  A heuristic evaluation and UI feedback session was conducted

                  of the prototype and tested its interactions. A lack of user

              <p>
                This prototype afforded users the ability to create their own
                improvement journey, so they can focus on their specific needs,
                not just general improvement. A question flow gathers
                information about the user’s current situation, and wants, then
                provides a custom journey for them based on their answers. This
                feature was a frequent request from user’s in testing.

              <p>
                Ball control, the vocal projection activity iterated upon since the first interactive prototype, received changes in text size, making it larger for user’s to see. The background colour of this activity now changes depending if the user has the right or wrong level of vocal projection. This change allows users to focus on the text being displayed rather than having to glance at the level of the ball. The user is more aware of their positioning and progression.

                All of the arm movement activities received UI changes in the form of colour alterations to be consistent with the UI colour coding throughout the application. Visual assets such as the bounding box area and the targets for exclamations were changed to be consistent between activities, appealing to the recognition over recall design heuristic.

              <p>
                Recite’s code adheres to the WCAG 2.0 (AA) standard. Also, Recite implements ARIA roles and labels for tags throughout its code. The UI has an ‘AAA’ contrast rating on all elements except for stylistic text, which is not necessary for any form of progression.
                <br>
                <br>
                Multiple accessibility standards and consideration are to be amended in future, such as the ability to skip activity sessions for users who are unable to complete it due to disability.

                Focus groups were used to identify any problems or confusion around the activity flows. From these groups we were able to identify what users generally liked and disliked about the application, and were able to define what could be redesigned in future.              </p>

              <p>
                The goal of Recite was to improve the public speaking self-confidence of young developing professionals by being enjoyable and interactive. Throughout the design and development process, young, developing professionals requested to use the product and can be seen smiling, and engaging with the activities in Recite. This was both when unobserved and observed by multiple people. These observations show that with a change in perception of public speaking, young, developing professionals can find public speaking non-intimidating and can enjoy themselves whilst practicing for it.
